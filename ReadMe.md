Quote from the
[Wikipedia entry about Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2):

> [Argon2](https://www.cryptolux.org/images/0/0d/Argon2.pdf) is a key

>
>  - Argon2d maximizes resistance to GPU cracking attacks.
>  - Argon2i is optimized to resist side-channel attacks.
>  - Argon2id is a hybrid version out of Argon2d and Argon2i.

> All three allow specification by three parameters that control:
